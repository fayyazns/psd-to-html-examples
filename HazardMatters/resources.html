                    <p>Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZ) are designated
                        by the California Director of Forestry and Fire Prevention.
                        Following the devastating firestorms in the Oakland-Berkeley
                        Hills in 1991, the California Legislature ordered the California
                        Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) to identify
                        fire hazard zones to reduce the possibility of uncontrolled
                        fires.  Properties in designated fire hazard zones are considered
                        not to be a state fire responsibility.  Notices must be posted
                        in various county offices explaining how to find maps identifying
                        these zones. Local agencies must designate by ordinance Very High
                        Fire Hazard Severity Zones within their  jurisdictions unless
                        they adopt equivalent or more restrictive measures of their own.
                        For more information, see Public Resources Code ?125, et seq.</p>
                    <p>CAL FIRE is in the process of gathering current data for an
                        updated mapping project. This is a massive project requiring
                        policy and procedure staff, prevention and planning staff,
                        and the technical GIS skills of CAL FIRE’s Fire and Resource
                        Assessment Program.</p>
                    <p>Some Countries and Cities have their own ordinances, for
                        example the City of Los Angeles establsihed its own Very
                        High Fire Hazard Severity Zone in 1999 and replaced the
                        older “Mountain Fire District?and “Buffer Zone.?The “Zone?was
                        carefully determined according to California State Law.
                        This zone requires brush clearance as well as adding further
                        criteria for maintenance of  landscape vegetation in such
                        a condition as not to provide an available fuel supply to
                        augment the spread or intensity of a fire. These criteria
                        included, but were not limited to eucalyptus, acacia, palm,
                        pampas grass, and conifers such as cedar, cypress, fir,
                        juniper, and pine. In February of 1999 section 57.21.07
                        of the Los Angeles Municipal Code was again amended, this
                        time establishing a fee for inspections of properties in
                        the City of Los Angeles to determine if a violation of this
                        section exists.  It is important to check with your local
                        fire agency for requirements in your area. See:

                        Following the devastating firestorms in the Oakland-Berkeley
                        Hills in 1991, the California Legislature ordered the California
                        Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) to identify
                        fire hazard zones to reduce the possibility of uncontrolled
                        fires.  Properties in designated fire hazard zones are considered
                        not to be a state fire responsibility.  Notices must be posted
                        in various county offices explaining how to find maps identifying
                        these zones. Local agencies must designate by ordinance Very High
                        Fire Hazard Severity Zones within their  jurisdictions unless
                        they adopt equivalent or more restrictive measures of their own.

                    <p>CAL FIRE is in the process of gathering current data for an
                        updated mapping project. This is a massive project requiring

                        and the technical GIS skills of CAL FIRE’s Fire and Resource

                    <p>Some Countries and Cities have their own ordinances, for
                        example the City of Los Angeles establsihed its own Very
                        High Fire Hazard Severity Zone in 1999 and replaced the

                        carefully determined according to California State Law.
                        This zone requires brush clearance as well as adding further
                        criteria for maintenance of  landscape vegetation in such
                        a condition as not to provide an available fuel supply to
                        augment the spread or intensity of a fire. These criteria
                        included, but were not limited to eucalyptus, acacia, palm,
                        pampas grass, and conifers such as cedar, cypress, fir,
                        juniper, and pine. In February of 1999 section 57.21.07
                        of the Los Angeles Municipal Code was again amended, this
