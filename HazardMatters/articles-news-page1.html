                friends until their dying weeks and it was not always possible
                to track them down. Many had become so caught up in their own
                lives that they had let golden friendships slip by over the
                years. There were many deep regrets about not giving
                friendships the time and effort that they deserved. Everyone
                misses their friends when they are dying. It is common for
                anyone in a busy lifestyle to let friendships slip. But when
                you are faced with your approaching death, the physical details
                of life fall away. People do want to get their financial
                affairs in order if possible. But it is not money or status
                that holds the true importance for them.</p>

                benefit of those they love. Usually though, they are too ill and
                weary to ever manage this task. It is all comes down to love and
                relationships in the end. That is all that remains in the final
                weeks, love and relationships. I wish that I had let myself be
                happier This is a surprisingly common one. </p>
            <p>Many did not realise until the end that happiness is a choice. They
                had stayed stuck in old patterns and habits. The so-called ‘comfort’
                of familiarity overflowed into their emotions, as well as their
                physical lives. Fear of change had them pretending to others, and
                to their selves, that they were content. When deep within, they
                longed to laugh properly and have silliness in their life again.</p>
